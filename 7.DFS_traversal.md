# DfS - Depth First Search

DFS is a traversing technique in which we traverse the depth first.

For e.g in this graph, let us say if we'll start from 1 then we'll go to 2 then if it would have been BFS then we'd have gone to 7, but we'll go to depth i.e 4, then 6 and then 7, similarly for the second component we'll go to 3 then 5, you can choose either of the 4 or 7 after 2, will depend on the adjustement of node and how you are traversing.

The driver code would be same as BFS

Now the process of DFS is done recursively that is why first it goes for the depth of the first node, then goes for it's next adjacent(if not visited), i.e left portion will be executed first then the right portion will be called after finishing the execution of left one.

## Time complexity and space complexity
* Time complexity would be ```O(N+E)```, N is the time taken for visiting N nodes and E is for traveling through adjacent nodes overall
* Space complexity would be ```O(N+E) + O(N) + O(N)``` same as BFS
N+E for adjacency list, N for visited array and other N for auxiliary space.

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void dfs(int node, vector<int> &vis, vector<int> &storeDFS, vector<int> adj[]){
    storeDFS.push_back(node);
    vis[node] = 1;
    for(auto it : adj[node]){
        if(!vis[it]){
            dfs(it, vis, storeDFS, adj);
        }
    }
}

vector<int> findDFS(int v, vector<int> adj[]){
    vector<int> vis(v, 0);
    vector<int> storeDFS;
    
    for(int i=0; i<v; i++){
        if(!vis[i]){
            dfs(i, vis, storeDFS, adj);
        }
    }
    return storeDFS;
}

int main(){
    int n, m;
    cin>>n>>m;
    
    vector<int> adj[n];
    for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
        int u, v;
        cin>>u>>v;
        
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u);
    }
    vector<int> ans = findDFS(n, adj);
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
        cout<<ans[i]<<" ";
    }
    return 0;
}
