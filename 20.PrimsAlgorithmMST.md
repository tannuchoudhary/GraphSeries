This would be the MST for the above graph

Steps:
* Start from the first node

* Find out the minimum edge attach to this edge

* Then in the next step find out all the adjacent nodes attached to the nodes included in the mst, so these marked edges are the attached adjacent edges, now find the min. among them

* and then choose the one with the least edge weight

* Repeat this process until total no of edges in your mst will become n-1, that is when all nodes will be connected

Let us look at one  more example for better understanding:

PIck the starting node

Now we can see that this node 2---4 has least weight but we can't pick it as it is creating a cycle, and there can't be a cycle in MST, because the definition itself says that this is a spanning tree, so a tree cannot have a cycle.


So this one will be picked:

below would be the final MST of the given graph:

##  Steps to implement this algorithm:
 * Create 3 arrays of size equal to total no. of vertices i.e n
     * key array of type int, initialized with infinity and source initializd with 0
     * MST array of type bool, initialized with false
     * parent array of type int initialized with -1

1. First of all we'll find out the index from key array having minimum key value, ans that would be the source, in our case it is 0th index
2. The moment you'll get the minimum possible key value, mark it as true in mst
3. check all it's adjacent nodes 
4. and if that node is not marked in mst then update it's weight in key and in the parent array assign the parent name
5. Like here we'll add 0 in mst, then will got to all it's adjacent node, first is 1, 1 is not marked in mst so assign weight in key i.e 2 and assign parent, the parent of 1 is 0 so assign it in parent array, but right now don't include it in your mst.

6. Do this for all adjacent node
7. After doing for all adjacent nodes, find the one having the minimum weight from the key array and mark it as true in mst
8. Now find the adjacent nodes and again store their weight (if it is not include in mst) in key and parent in parent array
9. Then find out the minimum among the key array(the one which is not included in mst) and add it in mst by marking that element in mst array as true.
10. You have to stop when you'll find out that the all adjacnet nodes of the next node is already added in mst.
11. Now you just need to print the parent array as like this as parent of 0 is no one, parent of 1 is 0, parent of 3 is 0, and parent of 4 is 1.

## Bruteforce implementation

```cpp

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void prims(int v, int src, vector<pair<int, int>> adj[]){
        //declare 3 arrays and initialize them
        int keys[v];
        bool setMst[v];
        int parent[v];
        
        for(int i=0; i<v; i++){
            keys[i] = INT_MAX;
            setMst[i] = false;
        }
        
        //initialize key of source as 0, and parent of source as -1
        keys[src] = 0;
        parent[src] = -1;

        //run loop upto n-1, because there would be n-1 edges only
        for(int i=0; i<v-1; i++){

                int min = INT_MAX, index;
                //find the node which have minimum key and is not visited
                for(int i=0; i<v; i++){
                        if(keys[i]<min && setMst[i] == false){
                                min = keys[i];
                                index = i; //index will store the index of the node having minimum key
                        }
                }
                //mark that node as true in mst
                setMst[index] = true;
                
                //go to its all adjacent nodes and find out which one has the minimum weight and is not added in mst
                for(auto it : adj[index]){
                        int node = it.first;
                        int wt = it.second;
                        //update the key if it has the minimum weight and is not added in mst and update the parent
                        if(keys[node] > wt && setMst[node] == false){
                                keys[node] = wt;
                                parent[node] = index;
                        }
                }

        }
        //print the nodes
        for(int i=0; i<v; i++){
                cout<<parent[i]<<"-"<<i<<endl;
        }
}

int main(){
        int n, m;
        cout<<"Enter number of vertices and number of edges for your graph: ";
        cin>>n>>m;
        vector<pair<int, int>> adj[n];
        cout<<"Enter all the edges and their weight: "<<endl;
        for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
                int u, v, wt;
                cin>>u>>v>>wt;
                adj[u].push_back(make_pair(v, wt));
                adj[v].push_back(make_pair(u, wt));
        }


        int src;
        cout<<"Enter source node: ";
        cin>>src;
        prims(n, src, adj);
        return 0;
}



```

## Time complexity:

* The time complexity would be  => ``` O(N^2) ```, because we have two nested loops both going from 0 to n
* Space complexity: Apart from the space taken by array, O(3N) for all the 3 arrays, therefore eventually ```O(N)```

But we can optimize it using heap data structure, i.e priority queue in c++, we'll replace it with key array to store the minimum element at the top, priority queue gives minimum value in ```log n``` so it would optimize our t.c.
## Optimized implementation

```cpp
//optimized implementation using heap data structure (min heap using priority queue)
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void prims(int v, int src, vector<pair<int, int>> adj[]){
        //declare 3 arrays and initialize them
        int keys[v];
        bool setMst[v];
        int parent[v];
        
        for(int i=0; i<v; i++){
            keys[i] = INT_MAX;
            setMst[i] = false;
        }
        
        //priority queue of (key, index)
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>> > pq;
        //initialize key of source as 0, and parent of source as -1
        keys[src] = 0;
        parent[src] = -1;
        //will contain pair of (key, index)
        pq.push(make_pair(0, 0));

        // Run the loop till all the nodes have been visited
        // because in the brute code we checked for mstSet[node] == false while computing the minimum
        // but here we simply take the minimal from the priority queue, so a lot of times a node might be taken twice
        // hence its better to keep running till all the nodes have been taken. 
        // try the following case: 
        // 6 7 
        // 0 1 5 
        // 0 2 10 
        // 0 3 100 
        // 1 3 50 
        // 1 4 200
        // 3 4 250
        // 4 5 50 
         while(!pq.empty()){
                int index = pq.top().second;
                pq.pop();
                //mark that node as true in mst
                setMst[index] = true;
                
                //go to its all adjacent nodes and find out which one has the minimum weight and is not added in mst
                for(auto it : adj[index]){
                        int node = it.first;
                        int wt = it.second;
                        //update the key if it has the minimum weight and is not added in mst and update the parent
                        if(keys[node] > wt && setMst[node] == false){
                                keys[node] = wt;
                                parent[node] = index;
                                //push the key and index of a node in priority queue
                                pq.push({keys[node], node});
                        }
                }

        }
        //print the nodes
        for(int i=0; i<v; i++){
                cout<<parent[i]<<"-"<<i<<endl;
        }
}

int main(){
        int n, m;
        cout<<"Enter number of vertices and number of edges for your graph: ";
        cin>>n>>m;
        vector<pair<int, int>> adj[n];
        cout<<"Enter all the edges and their weight: "<<endl;
        for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
                int u, v, wt;
                cin>>u>>v>>wt;
                adj[u].push_back(make_pair(v, wt));
                adj[v].push_back(make_pair(u, wt));
        }


        int src;
        cout<<"Enter source node: ";
        cin>>src;
        prims(n, src, adj);
        return 0;
}

## Time complexity:

* The time complexity would be  => ``` O(N+E) + O(N log N) ```, because we have two nested loops both going from 0 to n, that would make ``` O(N log N ``` by rounding off.
* Space complexity: Apart from the space taken by array, O(3N) for all the 3 arrays and O(N) taken by priority queue, therefore eventually ```O(N)```
