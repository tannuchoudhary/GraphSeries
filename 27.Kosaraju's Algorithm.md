# Kosaraju's Algorithm
Helps tto find all the strongly connected components in the directed graph

## Strongly Connected com
* In strongly connected components, every node will be reachable to every other node

* in the above graph G1, there are total 3 SCC(strongly connected components) first is {1, 2, 3}(order does not matter), second is {4} and third is {5}, 4 and 5 are not stronly connected bcz we can go from 4 to 5 but not from 5 to 4

  ## steps
  * You've to sort all the nodes in order of finishing time - we know that this can be only done by Topo Sort - ```O(N)```
  * Transpose the graph, i.e reverse the direction if edges - ```O(N+E)```
  * Do the DFS according to the finishing time, i.e whatever we have store in the stack - ```O(N+E)```

* T.C = ```O(N)``` for topo sort + ```O(N +E)``` for transpose + ```O(N +E)``` for DFS = ```O(N +E)```
* S.C = ```O(N +E)``` to store the transpose graph + ```O(N)``` for visited array + ```O(N)``` for stack = ```O(N +E)```
