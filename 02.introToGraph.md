# Introduction

## Types of graph
 
 * **Two types of graph:**
     * Undirected graph
     * Directed graph

## Degree, Indegree and Outdegree
 * **Degree, Indegree and Outdegree**
      * In Undirected graph
        * No of nodes connected with the vertex is called degree in case of undirected graph.
        
      * In Directed graph
        * No of incoming nodes in undirected graph is called indegree.
        * No of Outgoing nodes in undirected graph is called outdegree.

+Total degree of all the nodes in an undirected graph will be equal to the 2 multiplied by total no. of edges, i.e(2xE)

```
as we know that every edge is contibuting for 2 degrees.

## Path
* **Path in a graph**
     * **In an undirected graph**: Path is the sequence of nodes or vertex such that none of the nodes are repeating or visited twice in the path
     * **In directed graph**: If there is an edge between 1 to 5 then you can go from 1 to 5 but you can't go from 5 to 1.

## Cyclic and Acylic

* **Undirected cyclic graph**: If there is a cycle in an undirected graph then it is called undirected cyclic graph.

* **Undirected Acylic graph**: If there is no cycle in an undirected graph then it is called undirected acylic graph.

* **Directed cyclic graph**: If there is a cycle in a directed graph then that is called directed cyclic graph.

* **Directed Acylic graph**: If there is no cycle in a directed graph then it is called directed acylic graph, this is commonly known as DAG(will be used many times).

### Now the last kind of graph is the weighted graph, all of the above types will be there in the weighted graph also

# Weighted graph

  * Undirected weighted graph
      * Undirected weighted cyclic graph
      * Undirected weighted acylic graph
  * Directed weighted graph
      * Directed weighted cyclic graph
      * Directed weighted acylic graph

### Important point: If the weights are not given i.e if the graph is unweighted and you are solving a problem where weight is necessary and you need the weight to perform certain operations, consider the weight of each edge to be the unit weight i.e 1.
